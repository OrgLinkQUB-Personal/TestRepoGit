## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
theta1 <- 0.372
theta2 <- 0.376
```
where $y_t$ is the log transformed time series and the coefficients are
$\theta_1 = `r theta1`$ and $\theta_2 = `r theta2`$. It can be rewritten as: 
$$
 y_t = y_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t `r theta1`\varepsilon_{t-1} + `r theta2`\varepsilon_{t-2}.
$$
